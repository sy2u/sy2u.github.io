I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Bei Yu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~byu/) since Fall 2025. 
Prior to that, I obtained my B.S. and B.Eng. degree in Electrical Engineering from [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/) and [Zhejiang University (ZJU)](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) in 2025.

My research interests include Computer Architecture, Hardware/Software Co-design and Electronic Design Automation.
